Motive
------
I really wanted to practice and improve upon my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills so I felt the urge to build *something*. I must have been particulary hungry that day beacuse Edamam's recipe and nutrition API had an allure to it that I couldn't resist. So, I built an app that lets users search for and enjoy any dish they desire while also making it easy to keep track of their daily nutrition and calorie intake.

Technologies
------------
This app was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It utilizes AJAX to gather data from the Edamam API along with Greensock for some transitions.
